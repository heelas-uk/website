            <h1>St Augustine's Hack Club</h1>
            <h3>What do we do?</h3>
            <p>
                We are a club based in IT1 that meets every Thursday at lunch to build cool things. We work on a mix of hardware (robots, cookie cutters) and software (websites, games, apps). By hacking, we don't mean breaking into things; we mean creating, building, and finding creative solutions to problems.
                <b>It is nothing like a normal lessonâ€”it's not even close. We teach practical skills that are never on exams.</b>
            </p>

            <h3>Who is Hack Club?</h3>
            <p>
                Hack Club is a global nonprofit (501(c)(3)) that provides students like us with funding to run clubs, build projects, and attend events. They are supported by organizations such as GitHub (Microsoft) and individuals like Jack Dorsey (Twitter).
            </p>
            <h3>What's the catch?</h3>
            <p>
                There is no catch. However, some projects require you to publish the code you use, and of course, you must follow school rules and <a href="https://hackclub.com/conduct/" target="_blank">Hack Club's code of conduct</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>What's in it for me?</h3>
            <p>
                Hack Club offers several grant programs. For example, for every hour of coding, we earn 500 points that can be exchanged for food and other prizes. There are grants such as the <a href="https://bakebuild.hackclub.com/" target="_blank">Bake Build</a> grant, which provides funding for hardware projects, and the <a href="https://hackclub.com/grants/" target="_blank">Open Source</a> grant, which gives us money to design and build a cookie cutter and then buy cookies to cut. There are also grants you can pursue individually, such as <a href="https://moonshot.hack.club/606" target="_blank">Moonshot</a>, which gives you the opportunity to meet like-minded people in Orlando.
