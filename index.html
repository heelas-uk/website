                What do we do?
            </h3>
            <p>
                We are a club based out of IT1 that meets every Thursday lunch to build cool stuff. We make a mixture of hardware (robots, cookie cutters) and software (websites, games, apps). By hacking we don't mean breaking into stuff, we mean creating and building things and finding creative solutions to problems.

                <b>It is nothing near a normal lesson, not even close. We teach practical skills that are never on exams.</b>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Who are Hack Club?</h3>
            <p> 
                Hack Club is a global not-for-profit 501(c)(3) that provides students like us with funding to run clubs, make projects, and attend events. They are funded by the likes of Github (Microsoft), Jack Dorsey (Twitter), and Elon Musk (SpaceX).

            <h3>What's the catch?</h3>
            <p>
                There is no catch. However, some projects require you to publish the code you use, and of course, you must follow school rules and <a href="https://hackclub.com/conduct/" target="_blank">Hack Club's code of conduct</a>.
