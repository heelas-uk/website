                What do we do?
            </h3>
            <p>
                We are a club based out of IT1 that meets every Thursday lunch to build cool stuff. We make a mixture of hardware (robots, cookie cutters) and software (websites, games, apps). By hacking we don't mean breaking into stuff, we mean creating and building things and finding creative solutions to problems.

                <b>It is nothing near a normal lesson not even close we teach practical skills that are never on exams.</b>

            <h3>Who are Hack Club?</h3>
            <p> 
                Hack Club is a global not-for-profit 501(c)(3) that provides students like us with funding to run clubs, make projects, and attend events. They are funded by the likes of Github (Microsoft), Jack Dorsey (Twitter), and Elon Musk (SpaceX).
            </p>
            <h3>What's the catch?</h3>
            <p>
                There is no catch however, some projects require you to publish to code you used and of course you must of course follow the school rules and <a href="https://hackclub.com/conduct/" target="">Hack Club's code of conduct.</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>What's in it for me?</h3>
            <p>
                Hack Club operates several grant schemes for example for every hour of coding we get 500 points that can be exchanged for food and other prizes. There are also grants such as the <a href = "https://bakebuild.hackclub.com/" target="">Bake Build</a> grant which gives us money to build hardware projects and the <a href="https://hackclub.com/grants/" target="_blank">Open Source</a> grant which gives us money to build a cookie cutter you design and then buy cookies to cut. There are some other grants you can pursue individually such as <a href="https://moonshot.hack.club/606" target="_blank">Moonshot</a> which gives you the opportunity to meet up with like minded people in orlando.
